## Organization Intro
**Can you give us an overview of your organization and what it does?**  
Read AI is the fastest-growing meeting notetaker and AI assistant in the world, acting as a store of intelligence across meetings, messages, email, documents, and other workplace touchpoints. Based in Seattle and trusted by more than 100,000 organizations and 75% of the Fortune 500, the platform is adding over 1 million new customers every month. They value transparency and security based on robust, scalable authorization.

## Motivation
**Compared with other products in this space (proprietary and open), what drew you to the project?**  
- Considered alternatives such as Authzed.  
- Previously used a proprietary authorization solution but faced performance and scalability issues.  
- Sought a solution with stronger sharing capabilities, standard best practices, and open source flexibility.  
- OpenFGA stood out for:
  - Clear and detailed documentation.  
  - Based on Google Zanzibar, aligning with desired product functionality.  
  - Approachable, supportive, and responsive maintainers.  
  - Ability to self-host.  
  - Cost-effectiveness and high performance.

## Usage Scenario
**How long has your organization used the project?**  
- Evaluation began in February 2023.  
- Running in production since April 28, 2023.  

**Main motivations to adopt and key features used today:**  
- Need for scalable, reliable authorization with strong sharing semantics.  
- Uses most core features and integrates with Postgres for persistence.  

**Current level of usage and scale:**  
- Production.  
- Handles 5,200 requests per second under peak load with 20 ms p99 latency and 1.8 ms average latency.  
- Data store currently holds 5,323,283,829 tuples, growing daily.  

**Version and update cadence:**  
- Currently using v1.8.16.  
- Internal cadence: monthly updates.  
- OpenFGA release cadence is faster than adoption, but upgrades are smooth with no backward compatibility issues.  

**Adoption and integration experience:**  
- Aligning internal data models with OpenFGA was the biggest challenge.  
- Migration from proprietary system required careful design and data import.  
- Performance at peak load has been excellent; OpenFGA never a bottleneck.  

**Documentation utility:**  
- Documentation was key, with practical examples and modeling guides being especially useful.  
- Bulk tuple import documentation was referenced during implementation.  

**Measurable value:**  
- Improved confidence in secure data authorization.  
- Adoption of best practices improved internal design decisions.  
- Cost savings: reduced compute and hosting costs.  
- Reliable system performance even at high loads.  

**Future plans:**  
- Submit a case study and potentially a conference talk.  
- Open to further upstream contributions as engineering team grows.

- **Governance:** Limited visibility; appears functional but greater transparency desired.  
- **Community growth potential:** Strong growth with adoption from diverse organizations.  
- **Maintainer diversity:** Heavily concentrated in a single company; broader diversity needed for long-term sustainability.  
- **Maintainer response:** Responsive and effective; bugs fixed quickly, feature requests handled thoughtfully.  

**Participation in project community:**  
- Attend community meetings.  
- Reported bugs fixed promptly.  
- Track project progress actively.  

**Community engagement:**  
- Engagement via community channels productive.  
- Maintainers responded quickly to bugs and feature requests with high-quality outcomes.

## Project Improvements
**Challenges to full potential:**  
- Maintainer diversity; governance concentrated in one company.  

**Recommendations:**  
- Broaden the maintainer base and governance to improve sustainability and community trust.
