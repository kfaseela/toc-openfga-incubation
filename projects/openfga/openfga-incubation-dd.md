# OpenFGA Incubation Due Diligence

- Link to [Incubation application issue](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1287)

<!-- This template provides the TOC with the outline for completing due diligence of a project to move levels. This universal template is designed to capture all criteria so the TOC may ensure prior level criteria do not regress. As part of completing the due diligence, the TOC member should update the template to convey the level the project applied for the criteria by bolding the level indicated where the criteria is relevant. -->

#### Adoption

##### Adopter 1 - Read AI / Meeting Intelligence
_August 2025_

Read AI, a leading meeting intelligence platform serving over 100,000 organizations, adopted OpenFGA in production to achieve scalable, high-performance, and secure authorization. They were drawn to OpenFGA for its Zanzibar-inspired model, detailed documentation, responsive maintainers, and self-hosting capabilities. Since April 2023, Read AI’s deployment handles over 5,200 requests/sec with low latency, managing billions of tuples reliably. Adoption of OpenFGA has improved internal design practices, reduced infrastructure costs, and provided confidence in secure data authorization. The project’s strong technical foundation and active community have enabled smooth integration, though the adopter notes that broader maintainer diversity could further enhance governance and sustainability.

Reference: [OpenFGA Adopter Interview - Read AI](/projects/openfga/openfga-adopter-interview-readai.md)

##### Adopter 2 - Agicap / Fintech  
_September 2025_ 

Agicap, a European fintech serving over 8,000 customers, adopted OpenFGA in April 2023 to replace an internally built RBAC solution with a scalable ReBAC-based authorization system. Today, OpenFGA underpins all authorization across Agicap’s SaaS platform, running in both production and pre-production environments at ~250 RPS. The project’s flexibility, strong documentation, and responsive maintainers were key factors in adoption. Agicap actively contributes bug fixes and performance improvements upstream, participates in community meetings, and has co-presented with maintainers at KubeCon. Key strengths cited include OpenFGA’s robust ReBAC model, reliability at production scale, and an engaged community, while areas for improvement include maintainer diversity and support for idempotent batch writes.

Reference: [OpenFGA Adopter Interview - Agicap](/projects/openfga/openfga-adopter-interview-agicap.md)

##### Adopter 3 - Docker / Cloud Infrastructure & Developer Tools
_September 2025_

Docker adopted OpenFGA in early 2024 to replace its internal access control system with a flexible, ReBAC-based solution. The project is used in production across multiple services, handling 100–150 RPS, and has demonstrated measurable value by centralizing permission management, reducing manual overhead, and accelerating integration of new products. Key drivers for adoption included self-hosting, open-source availability, mature SDKs, and an active, responsive community. Docker highlighted the project’s robust performance, clear documentation, and strong maintainers as core strengths, while noting potential improvements in DSL tooling, batch evaluation optimizations, and broader marketing to increase awareness and adoption.
